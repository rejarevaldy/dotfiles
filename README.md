## No_Border-XFWM-Theme

A simple no border XFWM theme....
## Installation

1. sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/themes/empty/xfwm4
   - You can replace "empty" with whatever you want. This will be the name of your theme.
2. sudo touch /usr/share/themes/empty/xfwm4/themerc

_You can create this no-border theme for other window managers such as mate, cinnamon & openbox etc. You just need to change the folder namings to match that of your choosen desktop. I have not tested this out as of yet but I don't see why it shouldn'
